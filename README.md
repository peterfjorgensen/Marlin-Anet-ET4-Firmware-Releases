# Marlin-Anet-ET4-Firmware-Releases

This is a repository containing prebuilt .bin Marlin Firmware files for my Anet ET4 3D printer.

My printer is a modified Anet ET4 printer, updated with the Silent stepper drivers TMC2208 motherboard, a BMG extruder and a V6 hotend.
The firmwares are configured for this specific setup and may not match other combinations of extruder/hotend.
